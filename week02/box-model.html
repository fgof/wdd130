			<p>15 Verily, verily, I say unto you, ye must watch and pray always, lest ye be tempted by the devil, and ye be led away captive by him.</p>
			<p>20 And whatsoever ye shall ask the Father in my name, which is right, believing that ye shall receive, behold it shall be given unto you.</p>
			<p>21 Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name, that your wives and your children may be blessed.</p>
